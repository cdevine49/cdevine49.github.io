        <h2>Our Bells</h2>
        <p>
          At Summer Camp Bells, our motto is "only a fool would pay more than $7000 for a bell."  We don't think its ever appropriate for bell to cost more than half a key of uncut Columbian cocaine.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't just make bells, we make summer camp bells.  That's why all our bells come low jack for theft protection and an inner coating that peanut butter slides right off.  Good luck trying to prank this bell!

          <h3>Sue</h3>
          <p>At first, I was planning on buying a bell for about 7K, but thank heaven for Summer Camp Bells and their reasonably priced merchandise.</p>

            <h3>Adam Heates-Freedom</h3>
            <p>For years, I dreaded the first day of summer knowing that it meant three months of pranks on our cherished bell.  I mean, we already knew their camp was better than ours; did they really need to rub it in by taking our pride and joy?  But thanks to the fine folks over at summer camp bells, our new bell stayed safe and secure all summer long!</p>
